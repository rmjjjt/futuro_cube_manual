# Multiple scripts support - from FW 4.5 and RFC 0.8

From version 0.8, Rubik’s Futuro Cube Suite supports (together with FW at least 4.5) mechanism to upload multiple scripts. This operation can be performed only over compiled AMX files which are not MyCube.

Use: ”Tools-Install multiple scripts”.

Position of scripts, that do contain **ICON** information, can be changed by the user before upload, however scripts without this information will placed in an extra **WHITE** menu with cube symbols 1 to 6.

It is important to note that any time ”Compile and Upload to FLASH” is used, than all installed multiple scripts are overwritten by the new context!
