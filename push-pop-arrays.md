# Push Pop Arrays

Push Pop Arrays are special containers that work over existing arrays. Once initialized, they provide 4 simple APIs for pushing, popping and peaking various length arrays. Functionality can be used for example as LIFO storage for moves or structuring variables and many others.

Some other functions like `PushCanvas` and `PopCanvas` work with them as well.
