## Introduction

Welcome to the world of programming Rubik’s Futuro Cube. We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed creating this development kit. Rubik’s Futuro Cube can be programmed by using a simple, typeless 32-bit language called ”PAWN”.

This language has C like syntax and even if simple, is very powerful and fast. To get a little overview of what is possible on a very basic level and what the language looks like, please have a look at the available examples with short videos on our SDK page:

You will also need to download ([Rubik’s Futuro Cube Suite](http://www.futurocube.com/support/#sw)), available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS. The Rubik's Futuro Cube official signed USB driver for Windows is part of the installation.
